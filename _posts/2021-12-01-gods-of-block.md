## In ancient times 

both creative innovation and commerce grew around gods, housed in temples, which were the centres of artistic and financial activity. 

Legends and myths about Gods formed part of transparent public records maintained by communities. And under such a system both art and commerce exploded and expanded.

## Thousands of years later, 

shamans of the Metaverse have established media of communication and expression that takes artistic and commercial innovation to uncharted frontiers.
